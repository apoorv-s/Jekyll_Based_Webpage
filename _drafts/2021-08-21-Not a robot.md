### Important Points

#### PhD Program

1. Discussion with Prof. Cai: You don't like anything when you are sad.

2. Finding an advisor for the PhD program

3. Changes in research interest, new environment, new decisions. Have patience, not that i'm not losing my mind right now but I'm very hopeful that things will workout in the end eventually.
