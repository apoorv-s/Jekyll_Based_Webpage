Gaussian process regression or GPRs are type of supervised learning frameworks which are not restricted to a specific family of function. These are based on gaussian process and use the information availaible in the availaible data as the prior for the future predictions. A very unique aspect of these predictions is that the predictions are associated with certain standard deviations which quantifies the uncertainity in the predictions made.

The key idea which helps a lot in understanding the Gaussian process is the fact that one take a naive look at a function as a set of pairs $(x, f(x))$ at the points of interest (frog in a well ?!?!).

With this idea, GPRs connects these point based on a correlation function (also called kernel function). Since functions we are dealing with are generally smooth and differentiable, Kernel functions reflect these beliefs (prior in bayesian theory) by connecting these points with smooth curves. Called correlation function because they define the correlation between the points based on the separation in their input values.

#### Weight Space view

A simple linear regression model with noise gives the likelihood as
$$P(y|x, w) = \Pi  $$


#### Function Space view
