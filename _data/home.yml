Intro: >
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>I'm Apoorv Srivastava.</p>
  
  <p>I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href = "https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. I graduated from 
  from <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a> with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering. I also worked as an Executive Trainee in 
  TATA Projects Ltd. from Oct-20 to Aug-21.</p>
  
  <p>During my studies, I have developed keen interest in research in the field of mechanics. More specifically, 
  I am interested in studying how underlying structure of the materials gives rise to its mechanical properties and 
  how can it be altered to tailor the materials behavior. My CV can be found <a href = assets/documents/CV_Apoorv_Srivastava.pdf>here</a>. 
  In addition to research, I like running, reading, playing (almost every sport, though Badminton and Soccer top the list), and sketching. </p>
